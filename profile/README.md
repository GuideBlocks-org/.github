# GuideBlocks

Re-usable open source components for IOS, Android, Web Apps. GuideBlocks help your App iterate fast and free up developers to work on features instead of engagement.
Developers can add GuideBlocks to your App and then allow your Product Managers, Marketers, Designers launch the GuideBlock to target users without having do more coding or AppStore/Play releases.

You can also make an existing App component into a GuideBlock (see instructions), you can then keep private or publish here at https://guideblocks.org

## What use GuideBlocks?

Product teams are always asking their developers to tweak engagement elements of your App. The GuideBlocks mission is to let them change it themselves once you've done the initial coding.

So this is **Allow you to Code Once, Run Anywhere, Anytime and for Any Users**. When connected to the Contextual SDK and platform, the Product team can change wording, colours and then launch to targeted groups of App users (or all users) without an App release.

The other benefits are:

- Product Adoption audience targeting and analytics
- Improve User Activation and Retention without resorting to Antiâ€“patterns like Pop-ups and Push Notifications
- Make use of your existing app components by wrapping them into GuideBlocks
- Built-in no-code walthroughs, tips, announcements, FAQs, feedback surveys and more.
